## 📂 Selected Projects  
Here are a few of the repositories I’m most proud of:

- **Library‑Management‑System** – A Java-based system I developed to manage book loans, returns, user roles, reporting and notifications.  
- **Web‑Conference‑Management‑System** – Web app using CSS + Java tech stack to administer online conferences: agendas, speakers, registrations.  
- **Calculator** – A simple and user-friendly desktop calculator application built using Java, supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  
- **ui‑test‑automation** – A Python-based automation framework that I contributed to / forked, focused on UI-test scripting, reporting and CI integration.  
- **Weather‑App** – A JavaScript demo project fetching external APIs, rendering weather data dynamically, and displaying responsive UI.

*(Each project resides in this GitHub profile; browse the “Repositories” tab for full details, source code & documentation.)*

## 🧩 My Workflow & Approach  
- I typically **prototype quickly**: spin up a minimal feature, test it manually, then automate it.  
- I believe in **clean code**, automated tests and continuous integration — bugs found in production are **my issue** too.  
- I love **learning and documenting**: if I discover a useful pattern (say for test-data setup in Selenium) I’ll write a README-blog in the repo or add a wiki.  
- I care about **collaboration**: meaningful commits, descriptive PRs, and shared reviews make the codebase stronger.

## 📦 What I’m Currently Working On  
- Expanding the UI automation framework to support mobile hybrid apps.  
- Integrating machine-learning models to predict test failures (yes — predictive QA!).  
- Migrating one of the back-end systems to a microservices architecture on AWS.

---

## 🏆 Some Personal Wins & Highlights  
- Successfully built and deployed a full Java web-app under tight deadline.  
- Automated 70%+ of regression tests across a major UI module.  
- Contributed to an open-source test-automation framework and improved reporting clarity.

---

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate  
Open to:  
- Joint open-source projects (test tooling, developer utilities, internal platforms)  
- Mentoring / Learning partnerships (especially Java + automation)  
- Contract / part-time engagement in automation & back-end engineering

## 📜 Fun Facts  
- I once wrote a “break the calculator” test script that found a division-by-zero bug in seconds.  
- Outside work I’m a fan of board-games, hiking, and capturing long exposure photos of stars.  
- I believe coffee tastes better when debugging is going well ☕.
